the LGPL (which applies to most of the files), the GPL (applying to the
configuration system and some of the tools used for building) and the BSD
license (some header files). When looking at the source code, please check
the individual files' headers.

If you are using the binary packages, the LGPL applies to you, as the GPLed
portions do not become part of the binaries, and the BSD license permits
relicensing, so the LGPL takes precedence:
